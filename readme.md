## Notes
I originally planned to have multiple timers and/or to accept user input so that it wasn't just ONE basic timer. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to work on implementing all of that, so I could only deliver the pomodoro timer.  
 
Project could be enhanced by:
1. Accepting user input for custom study/break times
2. Adding audio or visual cue for when timer ends
3. Removing brower alert when timer ends so that it becomes fully automatic

FYI: In JavaScript code, the timer must be formatted using seconds, not minutes. For example, to set a 25-minute timer, the code must be 1500.
